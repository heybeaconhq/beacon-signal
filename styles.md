# Visual Style Library — 20 Styles

Named visual styles for the Beacon Signal workflow. Each is inspired by a real graphic designer. Ordered calm → intense.

**Picking a style:** Match mood first, content second. Ask: *"What should the viewer FEEL?"*

**Using a style:** Copy the Visual Language rules into your prompt's style section. Use the Example B-Roll Scene as a pattern — swap in your own content but keep the visual language.
